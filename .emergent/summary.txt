The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around deploying a full-stack PediZone CRM application, fixing deployment issues, migrating the database, and implementing various UI/UX adjustments. Initially, the user reported issues with Fly.io deployment and shared a GitHub repository. The AI engineer explored the codebase, proposed a two-app Fly.io deployment (backend/frontend), and began setting up Dockerfiles and configurations.

A significant challenge arose when the provided GitHub repository contained only placeholder code. The user later uploaded the actual application code. Database connectivity problems with MongoDB Atlas M0 on Fly.io led to a crucial migration to PostgreSQL. After successfully deploying the PostgreSQL backend, login functionality was restored. Subsequent issues involved fixing various module functionalities (e.g., customers, visits) and frontend UI/UX enhancements like changing the tab title, text labels, and adjusting menu layout. The conversation highlights persistent debugging, especially around database connectivity and frontend-backend data contracts. The current state is that login and core CRM functionalities work, and the AI is in the middle of fixing all module addition issues.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required assistance with deploying their PediZone CRM application, hosted on GitHub (), to Fly.io, having encountered deployment failures.

The application is a full-stack CRM system, requiring a backend (FastAPI) and a frontend (React). Key functionalities expected include:
-   User authentication (login).
-   CRM modules: Customers, Visits, Sales, Dashboard.
-   Map view (using Leaflet).

During development, the user explicitly requested:
1.  Successful deployment to Fly.io, then specifically to Netlify (Frontend).
2.  Configuration for MongoDB Atlas (initially), then migration to PostgreSQL due to compatibility issues.
3.  Admin user creation with  and .
4.  Removal of Made with Emergent branding.
5.  Removal of a Sistemi Başlat button.
6.  Change browser tab title from Emergent I Fullstack App to Pedizone Satış Ekibi.
7.  Change Ateşli (Fiery) to Lider (Leader) in Seviyeler (Levels) with emoji.
8.  Adjust menu spacing (reduce top spacing, then add slight padding).
9.  Remove the red PediZone logo from the sidebar.
10. Fix issues with adding new entries in modules (e.g., Ziyaret Ekle - Add Visit).
11. Guidance on connecting a custom domain to the deployed application.
12. Assurance that future updates and fixes can be easily managed.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   ****: The core FastAPI application. This file underwent multiple significant changes:
    -   Initially a placeholder, then replaced by the user's actual application code.
    -   Modified during the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration.
    -   Experienced various fixes related to database connection (SSL issues), user models, and API endpoints.
    -   Currently contains the full CRM backend logic adapted for PostgreSQL.
-   ****: The main React component, managing routing and overall application structure. It was updated to integrate the full CRM application.
-   ****: The login page component.
    -   Modified to remove the Sistemi Başlat button and associated logic.
-   ****: The dashboard component.
    -   Modified to change the text Ateşli to Lider.
-   ****: The visits management page.
    -   Modified to correctly send  data (, ) to the backend's  endpoint, aligning with the backend's expected data model for creating visits.
-   ****: Defines the application's overall layout, including the sidebar.
    -   Modified to remove the red PediZone logo.
    -   Adjusted to control the top spacing of the menu for aesthetic purposes.
-   ****: The root HTML file for the React application.
    -   Modified to remove the Emergent I Fullstack App title and replace it with Pedizone Satış Ekibi.
    -   Modified to include Leaflet CSS via a CDN link due to build issues.
-   ****: Global CSS file.
    -   Modified to remove the local import of .
-   ****: Contains database connection string (, later  for PostgreSQL) and other environment variables.
    -   Updated with MongoDB Atlas credentials and later with PostgreSQL connection details.
    -   Modified for SSL parameters during MongoDB debugging.
-   ****: Contains frontend environment variables.
    -    was updated to point to the deployed Fly.io backend.
-   ****: Configuration file for Netlify deployment.
    -   Crucially updated to specify the correct  directory (),  command (yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix all module addition issues:** The user explicitly requested to fix all problems related to adding new entries across all modules (not just Visits).
-   **Adjust menu spacing:** The user requested a slight adjustment to the menu's top spacing, indicating it's still too high for a professional look.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of addressing the user's feedback regarding the application's UI/UX and core functionality. Immediately before this summary request, the engineer had completed several UI adjustments:
1.  Changed the browser tab title to Pedizone Satış Ekibi.
2.  Updated the Ateşli (Fiery) level to Lider (Leader) in the Dashboard.
3.  Made the sidebar header more compact by removing the logo and adjusting spacing.
4.  Fixed an issue with the Ziyaret Ekle (Add Visit) functionality, specifically where the frontend  was sending  and  as separate fields, but the backend  expected them combined into a  field (or a dictionary under ). The  was modified to correctly format and send this data to the backend.

The immediate task being worked on was to add a slight padding/margin to the top of the menu in  to improve aesthetics, and then to comprehensively fix all remaining addition issues across other modules, as specifically requested by the user: ayrıca ziyaret ekle dediğimdme işlem başarısız diyor. lütfen bu ve diğer modüllerdeki ekleme sorunlarını taspit edip kalıcı olarak düzelt (Chat Message 584). The  file was modified to apply the spacing.
