The AI engineer's work primarily involved a comprehensive effort to deploy, debug, and enhance the PediZone CRM application. Key challenges included stabilizing deployment to Fly.io (backend) and Netlify (frontend), rectifying a database migration mix-up where the backend inadvertently reverted from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, and fixing numerous backend-frontend data contract issues. The process was highly iterative, requiring frequent re-deployment and debugging of API models, database schemas (), and CORS policies. Frontend UI/UX adjustments encompassed menu spacing, mobile responsiveness (z-index), adding delete functionality across all modules, and implementing dynamic dashboard features. A persistent obstacle was synchronizing local fixes with the  production environment, often necessitating re-explanation of the Save to GitHub process. The latest challenge involves a Not Found error for the  endpoint, which the AI just identified as a  mismatch.

<product_requirements>
The user initially sought assistance with deploying their full-stack PediZone CRM application, hosted on GitHub, to Fly.io and Netlify. The application needed to support user authentication, manage customers, visits, sales, and documents, and include a map view. Through the development trajectory, explicit user requests expanded to include:
1.  Ensuring successful deployment to production ().
2.  Database migration to PostgreSQL and its stability.
3.  UI/UX improvements: Correcting menu spacing/z-index (especially on mobile), removing branding, changing browser title, updating text labels, adding delete buttons for all modules, implementing clickable dashboard cards navigating to respective sections, and a Performance Indicators modal showing monthly data.
4.  Core functionality fixes: All module additions (Products, Visits, Sales, Customers, Users, Documents) must work, visit map must display points, admin-only access for Users module, and correct handling of document file uploads.
5.  Consistent and permanent fixes on the production environment.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Contains all FastAPI backend logic, including API endpoints, data models, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes:** Extensive modifications for PostgreSQL migration, , , ,  and  model adjustments, database schema updates ( function to  tables), date/time parsing logic (, stripping 'Z'), removal of authentication from GET endpoints (later re-added for ), and addition of DELETE endpoints for all modules. Added  to dashboard stats.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays key application statistics.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented clickable cards for Total Sales, Total Visits, Total Customers to navigate to respective pages. Added a Performance Indicators modal with monthly data.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Defines the main UI layout, including the sidebar menu.
    -   **Changes:** Adjusted menu's top spacing and increased  for the sidebar and its overlay to ensure visibility over other elements (e.g., maps), particularly on mobile.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages visit entries.
    -   **Changes:** Added  functionality and a corresponding delete button in the UI, including  icon import.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages sales entries.
    -   **Changes:** Added  functionality and a delete button in the UI.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages collection entries.
    -   **Changes:** Added  functionality and a delete button in the UI, including  icon import.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages document uploads.
    -   **Changes:** Improved file upload logic to correctly handle base64 encoding for document files.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays visit locations on a map.
    -   **Changes:** Corrected data access for map markers, using  and  instead of direct .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores backend configuration.
    -   **Changes:** Updated  (for PostgreSQL) and adjusted .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores the backend API URL for the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Crucially updated  to point to the correct Fly.io production backend ().
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes:** Removed , ; ensured  was present; added .

-   **Dashboard  vs  endpoint resolution:** The backend provides , but a frontend call to  fails.
-   **Visit calendar not displaying visits:** (This might be a frontend rendering issue or related to the visit data retrieval/format).
-   **Document add failing on file upload:** (Despite fixes, user reported işlem başarısız for file upload, indicating a persistent issue).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a backend service outage on Fly.io, which was found to be in a  state. After successfully re-deploying the backend and verifying basic login functionality with , the engineer attempted to retrieve dashboard data via . This request failed with a Not Found error. The AI diagnosed that the correct backend endpoint is , not , implying a discrepancy that needs to be resolved either by adjusting the frontend's API call or by adding a redirection/alias on the backend.
